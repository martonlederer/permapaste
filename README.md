# Permapaste

Permapaste is a web3 alternative for [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/) and [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com). It is built on top of [Arweave](https://arweave.org), which makes it stand out from other pasting tools by promising to keep the pasted content immutable, forever on the permaweb.
